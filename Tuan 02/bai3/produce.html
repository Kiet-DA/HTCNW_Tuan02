                <img src="./assets/img/photo5.jpg" alt="photo1">

                <p> Welcome to the home page of our family farm, Sunny Acres, where there's always something happening.
                    With the coming of fall, we're gearing up for our big AutumnFest and Farm Show. If you haven't
                    visited our famous Corn Maze, be sure to do so before it gets torn down on November 5. This year's
                    maze is bigger and better than ever. </p>
                <p> The Sunny Acres Farmshop aims to offer the highest quality fresh produce. You can pick your own or
                    buy it in our shop. Set amidst acres of outstanding natural beauty on the beautiful rolling hills
                    northeast of Council Bluffs, the Farm Shop is easily reached on Highway G, with easy access from
                    Interstate 80. </p>
                <p>The Farm Shop was established over 25 years ago with great success. Our products have won numerous
                    awards at local festivals and fairs. We also cater to local supermarkets in the Council Bluffs/Omaha
                    area. Look for our products every Saturday morning from May to October at the Council Bluffs
                    Farmers' Market. </p>
                <p>Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always open with reasonable prices and
                    great produce. Save even more money by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and
                    gardens.</p>
                <p>We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.</p>
